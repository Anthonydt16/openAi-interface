## Introduction

Welcome to the OpenAI Interface repository! This project provides a user-friendly interface to interact with various OpenAI models, including GPT-4, GPT-3, GPT-Vision, Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, and DALL-E 3. You can seamlessly integrate these models into a conversation, making it easy to explore the capabilities of OpenAI's powerful technologies.

The application is built using Next.js for the frontend and Styled Components for styling. To get started, follow the setup instructions below.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/openAi-interface.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd openAi-interface
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

   Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
